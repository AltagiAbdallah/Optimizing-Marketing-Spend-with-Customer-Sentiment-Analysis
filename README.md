## Project Overview
This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze customer feedback and correlate it with marketing spend. By merging qualitative review data with quantitative ad spend metrics, the system identifies inefficient marketing campaigns that are generating negative brand sentiment (high "Wasted Spend").

The goal is to provide a data-driven strategy to reallocate budget from underperforming channels to high-satisfaction campaigns, maximizing **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**.

## The Business Problem
Marketing teams often track clicks and conversions but ignore the *quality* of the customers acquired.
* **The Issue:** A campaign might bring in cheap leads, but if those customers leave 1-star reviews, the long-term cost to the brand is high.
* **The Solution:** An automated pipeline that flags campaigns where `Ad Spend` correlates with `Negative Sentiment`.

## Technical Approach
1.  **Data Simulation:** Created a hybrid dataset combining real Amazon Product Reviews with simulated marketing data (Campaign IDs, Channels, Ad Spend).
2.  **Preprocessing:** Cleaned raw text using RegEx, Tokenization, and Lemmatization (NLTK).
3.  **Sentiment Analysis:** Applied **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** to score reviews on a scale of -1 (Negative) to +1 (Positive).
4.  **ROI Calculation:** Engineered a "Wasted Spend" metric:
    $$\text{Wasted Spend} = \text{Total Spend} \times \frac{\text{Negative Reviews}}{\text{Total Reviews}}$$

### 1. Sentiment Distribution by Campaign
Distinct separation shows that `CAM-INFLUENCER` drives significantly more negative sentiment than other channels.

## How to Run
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/marketing-sentiment-optimization.git](https://github.com/yourusername/marketing-sentiment-optimization.git)
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk
    ```
3.  **Run the Notebook:**
    Open `Marketing_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## Results & Impact
* **Identified:** The Influencer Campaign had a **20% negative sentiment rate**, compared to just 6% for Facebook Ads.
* **Quantified:** Estimated **$13,000+** in wasted budget on the underperforming campaign.
* **Action:** Recommended pausing the Influencer campaign and reallocating funds to Facebook/Google Search.
